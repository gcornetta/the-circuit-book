\chapter{Network Theorems}

\begin{summary}
  This chapter deals with some basic theorems that allow the analysis of complex resistive networks. The most useful theorems to analyse the network behaviour are the superposition, Th√©venin, Norton and maximum power transfer theorems.
  
  There are also other theorems which are useful to gain a more in-depth appreciation of circuit analysis; namely, the substitution, the recisprocity and the Millman theorems. However, these theorems have limited use in circuit analysis since they apply only to specific types of circuits.
